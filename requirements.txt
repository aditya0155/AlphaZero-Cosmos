# Core ML Libraries (choose one framework, e.g., PyTorch)
torch
torchvision
torchaudio

# Or TensorFlow
# tensorflow

# Or JAX
# jax
# jaxlib

# Foundational LLM (example, depends on chosen model)
transformers # For AWQ models, consider using the latest version: pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
accelerate
bitsandbytes # For BitsAndBytes quantization. May also be a dependency for some AWQ flows.
# autoawq # May be needed for some AWQ model operations, though often not for basic loading with latest transformers.

# Data Handling & Numerics
numpy
pandas

# Utilities
tqdm # Progress bars
hydra-core # Configuration management (or Pydantic, or simple YAML parsing)
PyYAML # For YAML parsing if not using Hydra directly for everything

# Experiment Tracking (choose one or more)
# wandb
# mlflow

# Graph Libraries (for Symbolic Engine, GNNs)
# networkx # For basic graph operations
# torch-geometric # If using PyTorch Geometric for GNNs
# dgl # Alternative GNN library

# ARC Specific (potentially, if not custom built)
matplotlib # For visualization
# pillow # For image manipulation if needed for visualization or simple features

# Testing
# pytest

# Linter/Formatter (good practice, usually managed outside requirements.txt but listed for completeness)
