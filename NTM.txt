Problems: doesnt scale well with Larger data

possible use current transformer approaches

Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and their more polished successor, the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), were groundbreaking in showing how a neural network can learn to “read” and “write” to an external matrix. However, when you push them to large‐scale, high‐throughput multimodal data, they run into several bottlenecks:

1. **Computational Complexity & Memory Bottleneck**

   * NTMs/DNCs require a full attend–write–attend cycle over the entire memory matrix at each step, which scales at least linearly (and often worse in practice) with both sequence length and memory size.  This makes them hard to train on corpora with millions of tokens or high-resolution video frames. ([ACL Anthology][1])
   * In downstream tasks, this overhead often outweighs any benefit of algorithmic memory access, so NTMs/DNCs see little practical adoption outside toy benchmarks. ([ACL Anthology][1])

2. **Alternatives with Better Scaling**
   Over the past few years, several memory-augmented Transformer variants have emerged that address these issues more elegantly:

   * **Compressive Transformers**
     Rather than storing every past representation in full, they **compress** older “memories” (e.g. via convolutional or pooling modules) into a smaller summary, and keep only recent tokens in full resolution. This yields near-linear scaling in context length while retaining crucial long-range dependencies. ([OpenReview][2])

   * **Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs)**
     RMTs break the input into fixed-size segments and maintain a small set of global “memory tokens” that get updated recurrently across segments.  As a result, inference FLOPs scale **linearly** with sequence length—so you can handle millions of tokens without quadratic blowup. ([lims.ac.uk][3])

   * **Memformer**
     An explicit memory-augmented Transformer that tackles the “memory bottleneck” by combining compressed state vectors with learned external slots, striking a balance between capacity and speed. ([ACL Anthology][1])

   * **Retrieval-Augmented Memory (e.g. kNN-LM, RAG, RETRO)**
     Instead of a differentiable RAM, these systems **index** previous embeddings (from massive corpora) in an efficient key-value store.  At inference, you retrieve only the top-k nearest neighbors for each query.  This approach has been shown to scale to *billions* of documents with sublinear lookup cost.

3. **Human-Like Generalization via Compressed & Episodic Memory**
   Biological systems don’t store every sensory detail in perfect fidelity—rather, they abstract, compress, and index by relevance.  Architectures like the Compressive Transformer already mimic that strategy.  You can further combine:

   * **Modern Hopfield Layers** for associative “reminders” of compressed episodes.
   * **Differentiable Retrieval Modules** that selectively pull in long-tail knowledge.

### Recommendation

Given the extremely large, multimodal corpora you envision (images, video, text, robotics trajectories), a DNC/NTM is likely to become a throughput bottleneck. Instead, consider a **hybrid memory system** combining:

1. **A Transformer-based core** with sparse or compressed attention to handle raw context.
2. **A compressed-memory module** (e.g. Compressive Transformer or RMT) for long-range dependencies.
3. **A retrieval-augmented store** (kNN or RAG) for episodic recall across your entire dataset.
4. **Hopfield associative layers** for fast pattern completion on top of your compressed memories.

This mix will give you human-like generalization (by abstracting and retrieving only what’s needed) while scaling efficiently to the volumes you need—without the heavy write/read operations of an NTM.
