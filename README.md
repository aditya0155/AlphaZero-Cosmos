# Universal Reasoner (UR) Project

## Vision

The Universal Reasoner (UR) is an ambitious project to construct a state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI architecture and pipeline. The primary goals are:

1.  **Achieve world-leading human-like understanding.**
2.  **Secure Rank 1 on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark.**
3.  **Embody the "Absolute Zero" paradigm of autonomous learning.**
4.  **Demonstrate capabilities for handling problems of profound and potentially "infinite" complexity.**
5.  **Compete successfully in relevant Kaggle competitions requiring advanced reasoning.**

The UR integrates a hybrid cognitive-neuro-symbolic framework with advanced self-improvement mechanisms. It leverages a self-evolving curriculum, recursive architectural refinement, and a sophisticated evaluation loop, aiming to transcend current AI limitations and establish a new frontier in artificial general intelligence (AGI). All development targets practical implementation, initially within the constraints of 4x L4 GPUs.

## Getting Started

(To be filled in as the project develops - e.g., setup instructions, how to run components)

##Phases

This project is structured into multiple phases, detailed in `UR_docs/plan.md`. Each phase builds upon the previous, incrementally developing the UR's capabilities.

*   **Phase 1:** Foundational Setup & Core Absolute Zero Proof of Concept
*   **Phase 2:** Core UR Module Implementation & Enhanced AZ Loop
*   **Phase 3:** Advanced Module Development & Dynamic Curriculum
*   **Phase 4:** ARC-AGI-2 Specialization & Meta-Learning Integration
*   **Phase 5:** Towards "Infinite Complexity," Generalization, Kaggle & Ethical AGI
